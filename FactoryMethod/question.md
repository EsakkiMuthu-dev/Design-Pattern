## Factory Design Pattern Task

### Task Description

You are tasked with designing an online ordering system for a restaurant that offers various dishes on the menu. Each dish (e.g., Pizza, Burger, Salad) should be ordered through a flexible system that can accommodate new dishes without modifying existing code.

### Requirements

1. Create an interface or abstract class for the dish (`Dish`).
2. Implement concrete classes for different types of dishes (e.g., `Pizza`, `Burger`, `Salad`) that extend the dish interface or abstract class.
3. Create a factory interface or abstract class (`DishFactory`) with a method for creating a dish.
4. Implement concrete factories for each type of dish (e.g., `PizzaFactory`, `BurgerFactory`, `SaladFactory`) that extend the factory interface and provide an implementation for creating the respective dishes.
5. In the client code (order processing), use the factories to create instances of dishes without knowing the specific classes being instantiated.

### Notes

- Your design should allow for easy addition of new dish types to the menu without modifying existing code.
- Feel free to sketch out the class hierarchy and relationships between them to demonstrate your understanding of the Factory Design Pattern.
